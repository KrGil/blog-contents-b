### Feature engineering for machine learning

- Some of the transformations that people use to construct new features or reduce the dimensionality of feature vectors are simple. For example, subtract `Year of Birth` from `Year of Death` and you construct `Age at Death`, which is a prime independent variable for lifetime and mortality analysis. In other cases, *feature construction* may not be so obvious.

### Splitting data for machine learning

- The usual practice for supervised machine learning is to split the data set into subsets for *training*, *validation*, and *test*. One way of working is to assign 80% of the data to the training data set, and 10% each to the validation and test data sets. (The exact split is a matter of preference.) The bulk of the training is done against the training data set, and prediction is done against the validation data set at the end of every epoch.



## Deep learning explained

[Deep learning](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3397142/what-is-deep-learning-algorithms-that-mimic-the-human-brain.html) is a form of [machine learning](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3214424/what-is-machine-learning-intelligence-derived-from-data.html) in which the model being trained has more than one *hidden layer* between the input and the output. In most discussions, deep learning means using deep *neural networks*. There are, however, a few algorithms that implement deep learning using other kinds of hidden layers besides neural networks.
